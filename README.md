# python-for-all

Hi everyone, my name is Marina and I will be helping you to program in Python. 
Python is a very interesting programming language, but at the same time complicated if you don't understand what it does and how to do it, so I want to help you. In the "Python for Everyone" section, there will be various simple examples and tasks in Python that you can watch and try to do yourself. 
If you have any questions, be sure to ask, I'll be happy to answer them :)
